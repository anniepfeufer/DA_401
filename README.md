## Abstract
The agricultural practice of tilling is debated by researchers and farmers. It has long been
used to increase crop yield, though it comes with high expenses and environmental impacts. This
paper studies the relationship between tillage types and a farm’s ability to generate profit. It is
broken down between crop yield, expenses, and the amount of money a farm could generate after
paying off those expenses. In this paper, I found that there were significant differences across
tillage types in crop yield and expenses, however these two counteract each other resulting in no
significant difference in profit. For example, no till plots produced less crop yield which
indicates lower income, but there were significantly fewer expenses to pay off. Conversely, with
conventional tilling, plots produced higher crop yield which indicates higher income, but this did
not mean higher profit as they had to pay off expenses.
